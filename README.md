# GIPHY-API
Using the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To accomplish task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.
When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
